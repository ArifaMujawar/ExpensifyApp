-We make use of this line  historyApiFallback: true to fetch index.html all the time.

-exact={true} because path= "/" matches path ="/create" and others

-In this part of tutorial we are making use of Client Routing

-<Link> is used to avoid full page refresh instead javascript swaps things on the fly.
 Link tag is mostly used inside of application when we are changing from one page to 
 other,but for google search inside application we do not use link tag

 -<Switch> is used to check for single maching path at each time.

 -To have Header in all pages add header component outside of Switch tag

 -<NavLink> gives better experience when compared to <Link> in case of nav

########Redux###################
-Redux is a state management library. It is a javascript library that integrates 
nicely with react. It allows us to track changing data. it is pretty much same to 
component state

-WHY Redux??
- In Complex Apps it is hard to store states.


-Action is an object that gets sent to the store. They are a way to communicate with 
store
-Action type has to written in Caps.
- If we want ot print something to console when the state changes everytime, we can
 use store.subscribe()

 -If you do not want to print all time, add store.subscribe to a const and call that
  constant before store.dispatch()


  #### Destructuring in ES6 ######

  /////Destructuring Object //////
Ex: const person = {
    name: 'Arifa',
    age: 26,
    location : {
        city:'bgm',
        temp: 33
    }
};

console.log('Arifa is 26 years old');

console.log(`${person.name} is ${person.age}`);

const name = person.name;
const age = person.age;

console.log(`${name} is ${age}`);

const {name, age} = person;
console.log(`${name} is  ${person.age}`);

const {city, temp} = person.location;
console.log(` ${city} has ${temp} temperature`);

const {city, temp:temperature} = person.location;
    if(city && temperature){
        console.log(`It's $(temperature) in ${city}`);
    }

const {name:firstName = 'Anonymous', age} = perosn;
console.log(`${firstName} is ${age}`);


//////Array destructuring////////

In array destructuring we [] rather tahn {} in Object destructuring.
Ex:

const address = ['chavat galli', 'belgaum', 'karnataka', '590016'];

console.log(`I used to stay in address[0]`);

const [street, city, state, zip] = address;
console.log(`You are in ${city} city of ${state} state`);

const [, city,state] = address;
console.log(`You are in ${city} of ${state} state`);

//Setting default state
const [, city,state= 'Belagavi'] = address;
console.log(` You are in ${city}`);
